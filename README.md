# Pepega-Inject

An injector for Discord that allows one to inject CSS and JavaScript.

This injector is so **simple** that it does not require the modification of discord '*.asar*' application archive

## Installation

The prerequisite for using installer is that you'll have to install Python scripting language. You can the newest version from here: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). For now i recommend using ``3.7.5`` version of Python.

Just run the **``isntaller.py``** and select the Discord's main application folder and the injector will be installed.

## Developing plugins

The developing of plugins is super basic, just add a folder with the name of your theme in the created ``pepega-inject/plugins`` folder and drop some JavaScript and CSS files in there.
